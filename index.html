    <h1>Welcome to Ollivanders Wand Shop</h1>
    <h2>"Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C."</h2>
<p>Ollivanders is a wand shop founded in 382 B.C. Located in Diagon Alley South Side in London, England, it is owned by the Ollivander family, widely acknowledged to be the best wandmakers in Great Britain.</p>

<p>"Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great."</p>

<p>"I remember every single wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar."</p>
